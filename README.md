# CakePhp Cookie Authenticate Plugin

Cookie based authentication. An attempt to make it secure.

## Motivation

I need this feature on a cakephp project and after taking a look at 
[Cake3-CookieAuth](https://github.com/Xety/Cake3-CookieAuth) and reading [this](https://github.com/FriendsOfCake/Authenticate/issues/53) besides others articles and posts about security risks related to this feature, I've decided to do my own implementation.

## Requirements

- PHP >=5.4.16
- CakePHP >= 3.0

## Installation

_[Manual]_

- Download this: http://github.com/xavier83ar/cakephp-cookie-auth/zipball/master
- Unzip that download.
- Copy the resulting folder to app/plugins
- Rename the folder you just copied to CookieAuth

_[GIT Clone]_

In your plugin directory type

```bash
git clone git://github.com/xavier83ar/cakephp-cookie-auth.git [PLUGIN_NAME]
```
